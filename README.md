This final project for the 2024 Climatematch Academy investigates the following **research question:** 
How will precipitation patterns in the Gulf of Guinea change according to CMIP6 projections based on SSP5, and how do these projected changes compare to present-day patterns as established by CHIRPS data?

**hypothesis:**
Compared to present-day patterns established by CHIRPS data, we expect CMIP6 projections based on SSP5 to indicate significant changes in past precipitation patterns in the Gulf of Guinea, with wetter conditions during the rainy season and more pronounced dry spells during the dry season.

**group members:**
Aryaana Khan, Mukund Mauji, Joshua Gbiri, Diana Gonzalez Arroyo
